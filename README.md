# HiraethBot.js

HiraethBot.js is the third iteration of my previous Discord bot projects in Python and Java.
There are two major differences between this bot and my previous bots:

1. Obviously, this is written in Node.js.
2. This bot adds new support for the Plug.dj API.

In fact, the revival of Plug.dj and its community libraries provoked the port of this bot.
Do not expect further support on my previous bot projects for the time being.
This will be the main HiraethBot repository until libraries are made for other platforms.

## Installation and Usage

Installation of this project is relatively straightforward:

	https://github.com/TehTotalPwnage/HiraethBot.js.git
	cd HiraethBot.js
	npm install
and the can be run by:
	
	cd libs
	nodejs HiraethBot.js
